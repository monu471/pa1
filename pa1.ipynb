The method is automatically called when a new instance object is created from the class, and it is used to set up any attributes or other necessary internal state of the object before it is used"

    "A class can inherit properties and methods from one or more classes, known as its superclasses or parent classes. The class that inherits from a superclass is known as a subclass or child class. The subclass inherits the attributes and methods of the superclass, and can also have its own attributes and methods. In object-oriented programming, this is known as inheritance, and it allows for code reusability and modularity."
